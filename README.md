This project is built with Supabase as the backend and focuses on managing and analyzing website domains efficiently. It is divided into two core modules:

Domain Management

Allows users to add, export, and import domain URLs directly into a Supabase database.

Provides a structured and scalable way to organize large collections of websites.

Supports easy retrieval and updates for seamless domain management.

Website Health & Screenshot Monitoring

Automatically generates visual screenshots of each stored website.

Displays results in a clean grid-based interface for quick review.

Detects and flags issues such as loading failures, SSL certificate problems, or broken sites.

Helps track the availability and reliability of domains in real-time.
